# first-listen-dl

> Download mp3s from NPR First Listen

i made this because the NPR flash player thing is troublesome. they have it open in a new, small window, and then i lose it

### usage

```shell
$ npm install -g first-listen-dl
$ first-listen-dl http://www.npr.org/2015/07/08/420581193/first-listen-ratatat-magnifique
$ first-listen-dl --help
```

note: this'll only work for music _currently_ streaming on first listen. you snooze, you lose

### disclaimer

i'm not trying to encourage piracy or anything. support art. buy music. go to shows.

if you're NPR and you're mad, get in touch, and i'll get rid of this
